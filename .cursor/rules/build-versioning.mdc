title: Enforce Build Versioning with Hash
trigger:
  files:
    - "**/*.py"
    - "templates/base.html"
    - "Dockerfile"

  Ensures the Flask app build includes a unique hash in the build number and that this build number appears on the base site template.
criteria:
  - Python scripts or build tools must generate a build version that includes a unique hash.
  - The build version must be passed to the Flask app (e.g., via environment variable or config).
  - The base template (e.g., templates/base.html) must include the build version discreetly, such as in the footer or as an HTML comment.
  - Example format: BUILD-20250331-<hash>
examples:
  good:
    - |
      # config.py
      import os
      BUILD_VERSION = os.getenv("BUILD_VERSION", "BUILD-20250331-ab12cd3")

    - |
      <!-- templates/base.html -->
      <!-- Build: BUILD-20250331-ab12cd3 -->

    - |
      # app.py
      from config import BUILD_VERSION
      @app.context_processor
      def inject_build_version():
          return dict(build_version=BUILD_VERSION)
  bad:
    - |
      <!-- base.html -->
      <!-- No build version included -->
severity: warning
fix_suggestion: |
  Generate a build version with a timestamp and short commit hash in your CI/CD pipeline.
  Pass it into your app via environment variable or config file.
  Then render it in your base HTML template as a comment or in a footer element.
