# Flask Blueprint URL Rule

## Description
When using Flask blueprints, all `url_for()` calls in templates must include the blueprint name prefix.

## Problem
If a blueprint prefix is omitted from a `url_for()` call, the application will crash with a `BuildError` at runtime:
```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'endpoint_name'. 
Did you mean 'blueprint_name.endpoint_name' instead?
```

## Solution
Always prefix route names with the blueprint name in all `url_for()` calls:

### ✅ Correct
```python
url_for('blueprint_name.endpoint_name')
```

### ❌ Incorrect
```python
url_for('endpoint_name')
```

## Impact
- **Severity**: High - causes 500 internal server errors in production
- **Locations**: HTML templates, particularly in navigation and link elements
- **When**: During page rendering when URL generation is attempted
