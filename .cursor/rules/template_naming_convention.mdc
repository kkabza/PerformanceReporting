# Template Naming and Organization Convention

## Description
Flask templates must follow consistent naming conventions and organization patterns to prevent template loading errors and ensure maintainability.

## Problem
Inconsistent template naming and organization can lead to:
- `TemplateNotFound` errors during rendering
- Confusion about which templates extend which layouts
- Difficulty in maintaining the application as it grows
- Inconsistent user experience across pages

From the logs:
```
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: dashboard/performance_report.html
```

## Solution
Follow these guidelines for template organization:

### âœ… Correct Template Structure
- Place all templates in logical subdirectories (e.g., `app/templates/dashboard/`)
- Use consistent naming between routes and templates
- Template names should reflect their content (e.g., `dashboard.html`, `test_results.html`)
- Always confirm template existence before referencing in view functions
