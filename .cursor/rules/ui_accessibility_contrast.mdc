# UI Accessibility and Color Contrast Rule

## Description
All text elements must maintain sufficient contrast with their backgrounds to ensure readability for all users, including those with visual impairments.

## Problem
Poor color contrast between text and backgrounds creates accessibility issues that:
- Make content difficult to read for many users
- Create barriers for users with visual impairments
- Fail to meet WCAG accessibility guidelines
- Cause poor user experience, especially in different lighting conditions

## Solution
Follow these guidelines for text contrast:

### ✅ Correct Contrast Practices
- Normal text (under 18pt): minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold and larger): minimum contrast ratio of 3:1
- Use Tailwind's built-in color system which considers contrast (e.g. text-gray-900 on bg-white)
- Test color combinations with accessibility tools before implementation
- For dark mode, use appropriate dark theme colors (e.g., dark:text-gray-100 on dark:bg-gray-800)

### ❌ Problematic Contrast Examples
- Light gray text on white backgrounds (e.g., text-gray-300 on bg-white)
- Dark blue text on black backgrounds (e.g., text-blue-900 on bg-black)
- Yellow text on white backgrounds (e.g., text-yellow-300 on bg-white)
- Light text colors with opacity/transparency on variable backgrounds
